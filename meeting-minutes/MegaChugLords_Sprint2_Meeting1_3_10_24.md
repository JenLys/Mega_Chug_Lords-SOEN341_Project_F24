Notes:

    Here is some information we must consider
      We have 2 acceptance tests: can be from Sprint 1,2 or both
      For Sprint 2 we will need to add more features and finish some features from Sprint 1
      Do a CICD pipeline
      Add tests such that the pipeline would have a linter, a test, and a deployment to either Roku, Vercel, Render, etc (hosting services)

      Continue as we have been doing for the rest
      

To do:

    Everyone:
        Go over the Sprint 2 document
        Attend our next meeting (Oct. 6,2024) to create US and divide the tasks
